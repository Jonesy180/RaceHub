## v6.0.15 — Stage 8B Advanced Timing corrected implementation
- Built only from protected v6.0.13; rejected v6.0.14 was not used as a baseline.
- Implements the locked compact digital lap-time rows and corrected alignment.
- Advanced Timing ON requires every declared lap to have a valid non-zero MM:SS.mmm time before Save Result can proceed.
- Complete lap times auto-sum into the existing main race-time display; duplicate total-time entry is removed while Advanced Timing is active.
- Fastest valid lap is identified live; its lap label, digital time and ★ F.L. marker turn bright green. Exact equal-fastest laps are all marked.
- Optional lap detail is stored additively on the saved result without changing existing result/record/Result Accepted logic.
- Advanced Timing OFF remains the passed v6.0.13 Enter Result behaviour with the slim discoverability tile only.
- RaceHub only; rh-guide unchanged.

## v6.0.13 — Stage 8A Advanced Timing presentation foundation
- Built only from protected v6.0.12 Stage 7 Car Notes baseline.

- OFF preserves existing Enter Result and adds only the slim discoverability tile below Finish Position.
- ON removes discoverability and adds the collapsed/expand-in-place Advanced Timing presentation tile between car identity and the existing timer.
- Presentation shell only: no lap persistence, lap calculations, or changes to timer, position, save-result, Result Accepted, or downstream race flow.
- RaceHub only; rh-guide unchanged.

## v6.0.12 — Stage 7 Car Notes live overlay
- Rebuilt Stage 7 from protected v6.0.10 after rejecting v6.0.11.
- Uses the same proven rhOverlay / rhModal production structure as Edit Car.

- Existing v6.0.10 Stage 6 history and all prior systems remain unchanged.

## v6.0.10 — Stage 6 Event History + permanent Final Leaderboards
- Records now preserves each Championship/Event run as its own historical competition instance instead of collapsing repeated names together.
- Completed Championship and Event history rows can reopen their original permanent Final Leaderboard directly from Records.
- Uses the existing proven Final Leaderboard renderer and the original saved run/event data; no duplicate classification store was introduced.
- Active/incomplete history remains visible for record purposes but cannot open a Final classification until complete.

## v6.0.9 — Stage 5 Records / Hall of Fame / Stats integration
- Makes saved Championship TYPE the single trophy identity authority for all seven Championship types.
- Fixes Class/Type, Vintage and Classic runs so Save/Start persist the correct trophy identity instead of Festival fallback.
- Hall of Fame now uses the correct trophy for all new types; Class/Type Hall of Fame entries keep the dynamic Class/Type plaque.
- Records already consumes every Championship run generically; verified no parallel Records system is required.
- Locked Stats already counts every run/result generically; verified new types are included automatically in Created, Completed, Total Races and Time Driven.
- Extends the existing final-standings trophy/Champion label mapping for the three new types so completed runs remain type-correct.

## v6.0.8 — Stage 4 new Championship trophies

- Both use the existing proven Festival Championship setup/run/results workflow and 2-car threshold.
- Missing/UNKNOWN Year values are ignored.

## v6.0.6 — Class/Type suggestion positioned above input
- Moves the single remembered Class/Type suggestion above the field for phone keyboard safety.

- Uses the existing proven Championship setup/run/results workflow and 2-car eligibility threshold.
- Adds Class/Type discovery when a saved Garage change crosses the eligibility threshold.
- Stage 4 trophy artwork is not implemented; Class/Type uses the existing Festival trophy identity temporarily during this staged test.
- Vintage and Classic remain unimplemented because their locked year boundaries were not recoverable; no ranges were invented.

## v6.0.3 — Stage 2 smart remembered Class/Type suggestions
- Adds an app-controlled Class/Type suggestion chooser to Add/Edit Car.
